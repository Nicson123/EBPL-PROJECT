Project Overview
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze and classify the emotional tone of social media conversations. By processing textual data from platforms like Twitter and Reddit, the goal is to discern sentiments such as positive, negative, and neutral, providing insights into public opinion and emotional trends.

Dataset
The project utilizes publicly available datasets containing labeled social media posts. A recommended dataset is the Sentiment140 dataset, which includes 1.6 million tweets labeled with sentiment annotations.

Expected dataset columns:

text: The content of the social media post.

sentiment: The emotional label (positive, negative, neutral).

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy: Data manipulation and analysis.

scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and tools.

nltk, spaCy: Natural Language Processing tasks.

matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization.

Model: Logistic Regression (with potential extensions to SVM or LSTM).

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE.

Workflow
Data Collection: Gather social media posts, ensuring they are labeled with sentiment annotations.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing stopwords, special characters, and performing tokenization.

Feature Engineering: Convert text data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

Model Training: Train a machine learning model to classify sentiments.

Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Create visual representations of sentiment distributions and model performance.
